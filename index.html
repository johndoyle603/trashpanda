<h1>Meet the trash panda</h1>
<p>Long answer: According to Wikipedia, a trash panda is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 16-28 inches and a body weight of 11-57 pounds. Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the trash panda's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Trash Pandas are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.</p>

<p>They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebs.</p>
